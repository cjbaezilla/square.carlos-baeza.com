          "<strong>Web1 (1990s):</strong> Read-only websites. You could only consume content.",

          "<strong>Web3 (emerging):</strong> An internet where you own your data, digital assets, and content. No single company controls everything, and you can carry your digital identity across different applications."

          "It has its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transactions and services on the network",
          "It allows developers to build and deploy \"smart contracts\" — self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code",
          "It powers thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) across finance, art, gaming, social media, and more"

          "Think of it as a giant, global computer spread across thousands of individual machines",
          "It executes programs (smart contracts) exactly the same way on every computer in the network",
          "It ensures that operations are predictable, verifiable, and can't be tampered with"
        ],
        "importance": "The EVM is important because it creates a consistent environment where applications can run trustlessly — meaning you don't need to trust any single company or person to execute the code correctly, as the entire network verifies it."

        ],
        "difference": "The key difference is that DeFi operates without middlemen. Instead of a bank approving and processing your transactions, smart contracts (automated code) handle everything based on pre-defined rules. This often means lower fees, faster processing, and access for anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their location or background."

        "ownership": "When you own an NFT, the blockchain serves as a public record proving you are the owner of that specific digital item. You can keep it, display it, or sell it to someone else. Artists and creators often use NFTs to sell their work directly to fans without needing galleries or other intermediaries."
